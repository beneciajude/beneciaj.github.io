These projects were developed as part of UC Berkeley‚Äôs CS188: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence. Each project applies a core concept in AI using the classic Pacman game environment.

### üß† Project 1: Search
Implemented DFS, BFS, UCS, and A* search to solve maze navigation and traveling salesman problems.

### üïπÔ∏è Project 2: Games
Developed multi-agent Pacman agents using minimax and expectimax for adversarial/stochastic environments.

### üîÅ Project 3: Reinforcement Learning
Trained agents via value iteration, Q-learning, and approximate Q-learning to learn optimal movement strategies.

### üëª Project 4: Bayes Nets & HMMs
Used Bayes Nets and Hidden Markov Models to infer ghost locations from noisy distance readings.

### üß† Project 5: Machine Learning
Built and evaluated classifiers (Perceptron, NN, RNN) to perform digit classification and language ID.

You can check out code snippets, writeups, or demos for each module. Let me know if you‚Äôd like to collaborate on agent tuning, reward shaping, or extending the environments.
